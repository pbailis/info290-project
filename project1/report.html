# Smart Lock Security: An Experience Report

<!--- http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax -->

## Introduction

**PETER**

Just a few paragraphs; tl;dr

[This is a link](https://github.com/pbailis/info290-project)

New and subtle security vulnerabilities that haven't come up in
previous contexts. Usability benefits are much better -- worth pursuing.

## Background and Setup

**PETER**

Background on smart locks: what's the promise?

What locks did we buy?

What locks did we try to buy?

Related work; IoT references
Look in the car space; Grey system CMU Lujo Bauer

## Challenges

**PETER**

Getting lock availability ended up being a challenge

Bluetooth sniffing and proprietary authentication protocols

Installing the lock in the way that we can test it

## Usability

**LINDA**

Describe the user experience

 * Physical key 

 * FOB

 * Smartphone app

 * Challenges remaining: intent, context, and proximity

## Attacks

**GRANT**

For each, give a short vignette

### Physical Attacks

 *Stan the Burgler breaks open the lock with a screwdriver.*

 Jimmying the lock

 Interaction model

 Side of the door

 Proximity

### Relay Attacks

### Cryptographic Attacks

### Malware Attacks

### Summary

Where are the biggest vulnerabilities?
What is something to research vs. implementation error?
  * What's fundamental?

## Class Feedback

**PETER**

 * More thoroughness in terms of attacks

 * Service economy

 * Physical protection/price point too high

 * Multifactor authentication

 * Interactive surface
 * AirBnb

 * Why not use NFC, RFID?
 * Competitive analysis
 * What is available to the user?

 * Like the key sharing idea -- usability was good
 * Like seeing vulnerabilities live; positive feedback on demos
 * Like seeing security
 * Keep the touch-based interaction model
 * Other biometric authentication factors

 * *Conclusions: not enough time to cover everything; we're on the
    right track; next project: actually prototyping multi-modal
    interaction with smart watches---demonstrate defenses and fixes
    pertaining to the problem of physical intent during
    unlock. Bio-sensing 2FA*

## Future Work

**GRANT AND LINDA**

Reiterate how we like the lock

## Conclusions
