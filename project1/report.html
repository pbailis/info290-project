## Introduction

Over the past year, a number of "smart lock" technologies have entered
the consumer market
([Wired](http://www.wired.com/2013/06/smart-locks/)). These smart
locks augment the functionality offered by traditional door
locks---namely, mediation of access to physical space---with a
spectrum of features, including remote monitoring and control,
electronic (i.e., non-physical) authorization sharing, and hands-free
operation. The core selling point of these devices is
[*usability*](#usability): not only are the advanced features a
novelty to home automation enthusiasts, but these locks genuinely
offer new modalities of interaction with physical spaces.

Unfortunately, the potential benefits of smart lock adoption must be
weighed against new and subtle security vulnerabilities that arise
from their use. Notably, by interfacing the digital (and networked)
with legacy physical access controls, smart locks must account for a
range of [attacks](#attacks) that were previously impossible. For
example, the virtual compromise of a smartphone that is linked to a
smart lock may render a physical space accessible without ever
physically making contact with the smartphone, smart lock, space, or
user; in contrast, an attacker seeking to compromise a traditional
lock would be forced to resort to physical attacks on the lock.

In this project, we sought to understand the trade-offs between
usability and security inherent in these emerging
technologies. Specifically, we evaluated the usability and security of
a Kevo smart lock application, key fob, and lock. We find that Kevo is
susceptible to a range of attacks, including proximity-based attacks,
relay attacks, and directional attacks, raising concerns about
its security in practice. Nevertheless, we are encouraged by the new
user modalities enabled by this technology and plan to investigate
more secure but similarly usable technologies in the second course
project.

The remainder of this document proceeds as follows. We
[begin](#relatedwork) by discussing related work and providing
information on the smart locks we attempted to procure (and the lock
we were able to procure). Next, we discuss [challenges](#challenges)
inherent in our experimental setup. We proceed to describe our
[usability](#usability) experiences with the Kevo lock and outline a
set of [attacks](#attacks)---some of which we performed---as part of
this project. We discuss [feedback](#feedback) from the course
presentation and, subsequently, our plans for [future
work](#futurework) in the domain of smart lock security. Finally, we
[conclude](#conclude) with a set of takeaways for would-be smart lock
customers today.

## Related Work

We begin by briefly surveying related work. While these smart locks
are new entrants on the consumer market, there is a long lineage of
work in the academic community on improving physical authentication
via alternative electronic means. For example, [Balfanz and
Felten](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1251423) suggest the use of
hand-held computers (a PalmPilot) to alleviate the problem of
establishing intent with smartcard-based authentication (i.e., most
smart cards---in our case, physical locks, no less---lack an interface
via which the user can confirm her intent to unlock an electronic
resource). [Al-Muhtadi et
al.](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=898860&tag=1)
discuss the use of Kerberos authentication to control a number of
smart devices within home automation. The [Grey
system](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2157016) from CMU focuses on
using smartphones to mediate access to office spaces. Much of this
work focuses on *custom* prototype systems for the authentication of
users via non-traditional modalities; our focus here (i.e., for this
project) is on the capabilities and vulnerabilities of commercially
available smart lock technology.

## Project Setup

We attempted to procure a range of smart locks for security
analysis. We placed orders for a [Kwikset
Kevo](http://www.kwikset.com/kevo/default.aspx), [Goji Smart
Lock](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/goji-smart-lock), and
[Lockitron](https://lockitron.com/). Unfortunately, the latter two
products failed to ship due to manufacturing delays, and therefore we
proceeded to experiment only on the Kwikset Kevo.

The Kevo is a basic Bluetooth-enabled smart lock available on
[Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/Kwikset-Cylinder-Bluetooth-Enabled-Deadbolt/dp/B00CPTD5AQ)
for $219.00. Kwikset actually manufactures a number of traditional
lock systems, but Kevo is its flagship electronic offering.

For our experiments, we chose to install the Kevo in a two-by-four
piece of wood (rather than a door, which would have proven cumbersome
and likely have provoked the ire of the Soda Hall building
management).

<a href="#" id="challenges"></a>
## Challenges

Briefly, we summarize three challenges we encountered in this work:

 1. Lock availability was surprisingly sparse. Despite placing orders
 well in advance of the project's due date, we have yet to receive
 product from the other manufacturers.

 2. The Kevo lock uses a Bluetooth-based cryptographic communication
 protocol. Without the use of experimental hardware such as
 [Ubertooth](http://ubertooth.sourceforge.net/) or more expensive
 commercially available hardware that would enable us to sniff
 Bluetooth packets, we were unable to actually attempt relay,
 capture-and-replay, or in man-in-the-middle attacks.

 3. Pragmatically, installing the lock was somewhat of a pain. Without
 access to a full working environment in which we could install the
 lock, we ended up drilling holes using a (beefy) loaner power drill
 from the campus machine lock in one of our offices. The East Bay
 Express acted as a useful and recyclable carpet covering.

<a href = "#" id="usability"></a>
## Usability

Traditionally, the interaction model for a non-smart lock is that the user posess a valid key to the lock and for the the user to unlock the door by inserting then rotate the key. In other words, the traditional interaction model for a lock involves a physical authentication token specific to that lock along with a gesture of intent to unlock. As simple as this interaction model is, the interaction model is quite elegant. The only time a lock is unlocked is when a user has a valid physical authentication token and clearly intends to unlock the lock.

The Kevo smart lock offers this traditional interaction model as well, along with two other interaction models. Each of these two methods of unlocking offer unique usability benefits that traditional locks do not provide. For instance, the key fob allows users to unlock and lock doors with more ease. On the other hand, a smart phone app for e-keys allows for easy key distribution, collection, conditional keys (keys which only work on specific times of day, for instance), and logging possibilites.

Although these new interaction models are not without their limitations, these interaction models provide better ease of use to users and unique data previously was unvailable to users. We believe that if security vulnerabilities are adequately mitigated and interaction models improve, the usability benefits provided to users make a compelling argument for smart lock technolgy.

#### User Interaction Model

 * Physical key: To unlock or lock the door, the user has a key which unlocks the door and uses that key to unlock the door. The user can insert the key into the lock and turn the key one way to unlock the lock, and the opposite way to lock the lock.

 * Fob: To unlock or lock the door, the user has a key fob within enough proximity for bluetooth communication between the key fob and the lock, and then touches the lock face. If the lock is currently locked, the lock unlocks and blinks green twice (and optionally, if sound settings are also enabled, beep twice) to give user feedback. If the lock is currently unlocked, the lock locks and blinks red once (and optionally, if sounds settings are also enabled, beep once).  There is also a small LED on the key fob which blinks green or red when locking or unlocking, respectively.

 * Smartphone app: To unlock or lock the door, the user starts the Kevo smart lock appplication on a smartphone. Once authenticated into the application, the user can then selct a lock to interact with from a liste of locks that the user has access to, then press a button to specifically lock or specifically unlock the lock. Once the application performs an action, the phone vibrates to give the user an indication that the appropriate action has been taken.

#### Required Setup


#### Information Available to the User

With traditional locks, there is not much information available to the user about a specific lock. With the Kevo smart lock application, users are able to access: a log of who has used an e-key to lock or unlock a specific lock in recent history, the list of people who have an e-key to a specific lock, the number and types (such as conditional keys) of e-keys for that lock, and if the lock has been disabled or not.

![Kevo Logs](http://gadgetreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/kevo-App-650x576.jpg)

However, we found that some important data points were not available to the user, such as the status of the lock, logged events for any locking and unlocking with physical keys and key fobs, and what options the lock was configured to at the moment (if sound, light, or safety mode was on).

## Attacks

<!--- Grant, I don't think I should talk about proximity as a challenge in the usability section.. users don't have any new challenges unlocking if they are near or far.. if anything, it makes it easier for them. I think tha talking about proximity issues could be addressed solely in your section. 

The original plan was to also inclulde it in usability, which is what all three of us agreed upon, hence this comment.-->

<a href="#" id="feedback"></a>
## Class Feedback

We summarize the feedback we received from our in-class presentation
in three primary categories:

 1. **Greater detail about security issues.** Several responses highlighted
 their interest in the security aspects of this work. While security
 is undoubtedly an important aspect of our daily lives, it is easy to
 forget about, and, for one member of this project group, thinking
 about security issues is, in itself, novel. However, a number of
 responses asked for greater detail and thoroughness with respect to
 the attacks we considered as part of this course.

 2. **Additional applications.** Several responses (and in-class
 discussion) suggested potential applications for smart lock
 technology. Applications included the adoption of this technology for
 hotel rooms, AirBnb, and, more generally, simplification of
 authentication for the sharing economy. Other responses expressed
 enthusiasm for the concept of virtual key sharing.

 3. **Potential extensions.** Perhaps the largest category of feedback
 we received dealt with way of improving the security of these
 devices. Suggestions included multi-factor authentication, use of
 near-field communication, and the use of alternative biometric factors.

**Our response:** In all, this feedback was well targeted towards the
  issues we had been thinking about: given our findings, how do we
  improve the security of these devices without compromising
  usability? Unfortunately, seven minutes did not allow a detailed
  discussion of our attack study, but we felt that the demonstration
  we *were* able to perform was useful in conveying both the utility
  and the dangers of this technology. The next section provides
  greater detail as to how we plan to apply this feedback towards the
  second course project.

## Conclusions

In this project, we evaluated the security implications of a smart
lock, the Kevo Kwikset, compared to the usability benefits it
offers. While we are excited by the usability benefits---including key
sharing and authentication logging---we are concerned about the
potential vulnerabilities---in particular, those pertaining to
ambiguous intent in physical spaces. In the next project, we plan to
address these issues of intent by incorporating additional biometric
feedback---in the form of watch proximity---to preserve many of these
usability gains while alleviating a large class of security concerns.
