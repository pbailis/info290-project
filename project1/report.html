## Introduction

Over the past year, a number of "smart lock" technologies have entered
the consumer market
([Wired](http://www.wired.com/2013/06/smart-locks/)). These smart
locks augment the functionality offered by traditional door
locks---namely, mediation of access to physical space---with a
spectrum of features, including remote monitoring and control,
electronic (i.e., non-physical) authorization sharing, and hands-free
operation. The core selling point of these devices is
[*usability*](#usability): not only are the advanced features a
novelty to home automation enthusiasts, but these locks genuinely
offer new modalities of interaction with physical spaces.

Unfortunately, the potential benefits of smart lock adoption must be
weighed against new and subtle security vulnerabilities that arise
from their use. Notably, by interfacing the digital (and networked)
with legacy physical access controls, smart locks must account for a
range of [attacks](#attacks) that were previously impossible. For
example, the virtual compromise of a smartphone that is linked to a
smart lock may render a physical space accessible without ever
physically making contact with the smartphone, smart lock, space, or
user; in contrast, an attacker seeking to compromise a traditional
lock would be forced to resort to physical attacks on the lock.

In this project, we sought to understand the trade-offs between
usability and security inherent in these emerging
technologies. Specifically, we evaluated the usability and security of
a Kevo smart lock application, key fob, and lock. We find that Kevo is
susceptible to a range of attacks, including proximity-based attacks,
relay attacks, and directional attacks, raising concerns about
its security in practice. Nevertheless, we are encouraged by the new
user modalities enabled by this technology and plan to investigate
more secure but similarly usable technologies in the second course
project.

The remainder of this document proceeds as follows. We
[begin](#relatedwork) by discussing related work and providing
information on the smart locks we attempted to procure (and the lock
we were able to procure). Next, we discuss [challenges](#challenges)
inherent in our experimental setup. We proceed to describe our
[usability](#usability) experiences with the Kevo lock and outline a
set of [attacks](#attacks)---some of which we performed---as part of
this project. We discuss [feedback](#feedback) from the course
presentation and, subsequently, our plans for [future
work](#futurework) in the domain of smart lock security. Finally, we
[conclude](#conclude) with a set of takeaways for would-be smart lock
customers today.

## Related Work

We begin by briefly surveying related work. While these smart locks
are new entrants on the consumer market, there is a long lineage of
work in the academic community on improving physical authentication
via alternative electronic means. For example, [Balfanz and
Felten](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1251423) suggest the use of
hand-held computers (a PalmPilot) to alleviate the problem of
establishing intent with smartcard-based authentication (i.e., most
smart cards---in our case, physical locks, no less---lack an interface
via which the user can confirm her intent to unlock an electronic
resource). [Al-Muhtadi et
al.](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=898860&tag=1)
discuss the use of Kerberos authentication to control a number of
smart devices within home automation. The [Grey
system](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2157016) from CMU focuses on
using smartphones to mediate access to office spaces. Much of this
work focuses on *custom* prototype systems for the authentication of
users via non-traditional modalities; our focus here (i.e., for this
project) is on the capabilities and vulnerabilities of commercially
available smart lock technology.

## Class Feedback

**PETER**

 * More thoroughness in terms of attacks

 * Service economy

 * Physical protection/price point too high

 * Multifactor authentication

 * Interactive surface
 * AirBnb

 * Why not use NFC, RFID?
 * Competitive analysis
 * What is available to the user?

 * Like the key sharing idea -- usability was good
 * Like seeing vulnerabilities live; positive feedback on demos
 * Like seeing security
 * Keep the touch-based interaction model
 * Other biometric authentication factors

 * *Conclusions: not enough time to cover everything; we're on the
    right track; next project: actually prototyping multi-modal
    interaction with smart watches---demonstrate defenses and fixes
    pertaining to the problem of physical intent during
    unlock. Bio-sensing 2FA*
